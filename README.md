# MPI-Matrix-Multiply

Made this for COS436 Parallel & Distributed Computing during undergrad. It performs matrix multiplication using mpi. You input two text files in the same folder (a.txt & b.txt). They have numbers separated by spaces. Change the hardcoded size values in the matrix.c file at the top of the main. It runs through and performs matrix multipliation on the two matrices. Then, it outputs a new text file (c.txt), and prints out the results.
